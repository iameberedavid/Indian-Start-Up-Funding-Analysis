## Project Scenario

It is assumed that my team is trying to venture into the Indian start-up ecosystem. As the data expert of the team, I am to investigate the ecosystem and propose the best course of action.

## Introduction

The CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework was used as a guide to explore the data and observe the patterns that generated very important insights. This framework involves:

- Business understanding: understanding the needs of my team
- Data understanding: understanding the data and the expected information
- Data preparation: cleaning the data and formatting the data types
- Modelling: manipulating the data to draw insights
- Evaluation: assessing the results against the business objectives and
- Deployment: presenting the findings.

This project did not include data modelling, and was only deployed to Power BI to visualize the findings. 

## Hypothesis
Null hypothesis: The sector a start-up belongs to did not influence the funding amount the start-up received.
Alternate hypothesis: The sector a start-up belongs to influenced the funding amount the start-up received.

## Analytical Questions

1. How many start-ups got funded each year?

2. What is the total funding amount received by start-ups each year?

3. Which ten start-ups received the most funding?

4. Which ten start-ups received the least funding?

5. Which ten sectors received the most funding?

6. Which ten sectors received the least funding?

7. Which ten headquarters received the most funding?

8. Which ten headquarters received the least funding?

9. What is the trend of funding received by start-ups in the top 5 headquarters from 2018 to 2021?
